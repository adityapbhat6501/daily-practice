# Day 1 - MVP & Hackathon Structure

## ✅ What I Learned Today

### 1. What is MVP?
- MVP stands for **Minimum Viable Product**.
- It is the **smallest functional version** of your idea that **solves the core problem**.
- It should be **simple, usable, and demo-ready**, not perfect.

### 2. Hackathon Structure
- Hackathon usually begins with **problem statement announcement**.
- Then, the team **brainstorms**, selects the **tech stack**, and **designs the MVP**.
- Development happens in **phases**:
  - Basic working prototype
  - Add UI
  - Add optional features (only if time allows)
- Final stage: **Presentation + Live Demo**.

### 3. Why MVP is Important
- Saves time.
- Helps you stay focused.
- Shows **proof of concept** instead of building everything.
